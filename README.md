# Differentiator
The program differentiates expressions of one variable (x).  
You need to enter in the file data.txt the expression (at the end of the expression entry, it is necessary to put the $ symbol, this is done for the convenience of the recursive descent algorithm):  
3/x + ln(x)$  
The program supports the following operations:  
( + ) - add;  
( - ) - sub;  
( * ) - mul;  
( / ) - div;  
( ^ ) - degree (the exponent is an integer);  
sin()  
cos()  
ln()  
Next, the program will generate a data.pdf file, which will contain all the information on the differentiable expression.
